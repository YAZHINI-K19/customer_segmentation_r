Overview

This project demonstrates a data-driven customer segmentation analysis using K-Means clustering on a simulated dataset. The goal is to group customers based on income and spending behavior, uncovering actionable insights for targeted marketing and strategic business decisions. The results are visualized in a professionally designed poster using R.


---

Objectives

Apply unsupervised learning (K-Means clustering) to identify distinct customer segments.

Visualize clusters using spending score and annual income.

Analyze the demographic distribution (age) within each cluster.

Summarize key financial characteristics per cluster.

Dataset Description

The dataset is synthetically generated, containing 200 customer records with the following features:

Feature	Description

customer_id	Unique identifier for each customer
age	Customer age (ranging from 18 to 65)
annual_income	Annual income in USD (from $20,000 to $120,000)
spending_score	Score (1â€“100) representing spending behavior

Clustering Details

Parameter	Value

Algorithm	K-Means
Number of Clusters	4
Features Used	annual_income, spending_score
Initialization	25 random starts for stable convergence

Visual Components of the Poster

1. Income vs Spending Score

A scatter plot showing customer clusters based on their income and spending behavior.

Each cluster is represented by a distinct color.



2. Age Distribution by Cluster

A histogram displaying the age range of customers in each cluster.

Helps identify demographic trends within segments.



3. Average Income and Spending Score by Cluster

A bar chart comparing the average income and scaled spending score for each cluster.

Provides insights into financial behavior per group.
